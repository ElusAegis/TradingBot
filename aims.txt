Aim:

Create an automated trading bot for Binance in Python using Machine Learning. The Bot will make desitions based on the price chart as well as recent news. Also create a testing enviroment with visual client, as well as a light tester.

Project structure:

It will consist of 4 components:

1. Visual simulator
2. Light simulator 
3. Bot logic
4. Live trading wrapper 


Requirments:
1. Data (27.03.2020-)
✅	1. Gather stock price data for a considerable period of time, and save it for futher referance (27.03.2020)

		Plan: Use binance API to gather KandelStick data repeatedly, and append it to the existing file, run until interaupted 

		Realisation:

		With some modifications due to recent changes in binance

✅	2. Update exicting records with new data of stock prices (27.03.2020)
	3. Get current market deapth data
	4. Get most recent trading preiod data
2. Create visual testing enviroment (22.03.2020-24.03.2020)
✅	1. View the price change 
✅	2. Allow live market data
✅	3. Allow market data from file 
✅	4. See trading statistics
3. Create light test environment 
✅	1. Create a simple dumn bot (27.03.2020)
		a) Initialise function
		b) decide if need to buy using recent price info
		c) hold info about current open orders
✅	2. Allow market data from file (27.03.2020)
	3. Choose starting point (27.03.2020)
✅		a) Randomly 
		b) From input 
	4. Get bot trading statistics
✅	5. Fast! (27.03.2020)
4. Create bot-binance interaction wrapper 
	1. Use Binance-Python package 
5. Create bot logic using ML
	1. Build a ML model for trading using just stock price data
		https://www.researchgate.net/post/Can_Machine_Learning_Techniques_Be_Used_To_Predict_Stock_Prices

		a) Reinforement model 
		b) NN models 
		c) Use degrading memory
		d) Kaggle models 
	2. Add other numbers 
		a) Market deapth
		b) Amount of demand 
		c) Other paraments 
	3. Find out what is useful
	4. Add news coverage
		1. Find top n synonyms for a given key word
		2. Find news for list of given words 
		3. Classify news as positive-negative
		4. Give each source a rating of trust
